# Don't Budge It

## A simple budget allocation software

### Story
This project arose as a result of my poor financial management. After scrambling around at the end of
every month worrying about whether I can afford to pay all my bills, and getting fed up with all the
solutions I found recommended on the web, I figured that if I can't build the solution myself, then
it's a lost cause.


### Goals
The goal here is to create a budgeting application that simplifies the organization of your finances.
By allowing you to simply input income and expenses, and having the application present the breakdown of your
finances in a visually comprehensible manner. The hope is that this application
can help students, individuals, and anybody like me manage their finance despite their constant worrying.
Opening the application, and at a glance being able to change their incoming funds, or add an emergency expense,
perhaps even allowing you to set a savings goal, with deposits recommended by the application. While this can obviously
be used by anyone, it will focus on financial management for individuals, unless the opportunity presents itself 
to add additional functionality.

TLDR; A budget manager that is:
- *Simple*
- *Fast*
- *Organized*

### User Stories
These are some descriptions of future functionality that should be added:

1. As a user, I want to be able to update my bank balance quickly
2. As a user, I want to be able to add income sources, and have them represented as a lump sum, *while also* being 
able to see the breakdown
3. As a user, I want to be able to add expenses to my expense record that subtract from my income.
4. As a user, I want to be able to see my surplus funds and set a savings goal (%) for the remaining funds.
5. As a user, I want to be able to categorize the income and expenses freely, even mixing the two if possible.
6. As a user, I want to be able to set interest rates on debt that I hold and see the effects of paying off early.
7. As a user, I want receipts weekly, monthly, and yearly showing my financial history.
8. As a user, I want to be able to add individual expenses that I want to record for future reference.
9. As a user, I want to be able to plan long term savings goals with interest.
